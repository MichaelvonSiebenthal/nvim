# Motivations

I am trying to familiarize myself with vim and git. I uploaded my init.vim in this repository in part to save it for myself and also as an exercise to familiarize myself with git.

As I am completely new to vim and git it took me a long time (too long ^^) to get my vim running (especially Latex). So if my set up is of use to anyone please feel free to use it, however I am a beginner so do not expect this init.vim to be perfect.
